Compared with single-document summarization, it's more challenging because an increasing number of input documents will make the source information more redundant and scattered. It also has practical significance, for example, key information of multiple news articles can be generated efficiently. Multi-document summarization approaches can also be applied in other scenarios, such as extracting opinions from social media.",

Other methods employ graphs to model relationships and can leverage interaction features to enhance representation (Yasunaga et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020) .

This capability enables them to require only a small amount of data to fine-tune downstream tasks and achieve impressive results. Among various language models, BART (Lewis et al., 2020) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) excel particularly in generation tasks. Some models leverage them as backbone and generate high-quality summaries (Pasunuru et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022) . However, these pre-trained models are designed for general generation tasks without specific optimizations for MDS. To address this limitation, some researchers have modified objective functions during pre-training to better align models with this task (Zhang et al., 2020a; Xiao et al., 2022) . Despite being the latest models, they have drawbacks such as the requirement for largescale corpora and relatively low summarization efficiency. Moreover, the knowledge acquired during pre-training may introduce unwanted external factors that can affect the quality of summaries.",

Existing supervised models rely heavily on advanced features such as word vectors and outputs from hidden layers of neural networks, overlooking important low-level features present in raw texts. Therefore, our motivation is to leverage these low-level features, such as lexical features, from raw texts to rapidly mine information and achieve unsupervised summariza-tion. We introduce GLIMMER, illustrated in Figure 1 , which constructs a sentence graph to represent interaction relations. Unlike the graph-based methods mentioned earlier, our approach does not rely on neural layers to handle graph features. Instead, it identifies semantic clusters from the graph in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we mine lexical features from raw texts to facilitate graph cut. Subsequently, each semantic cluster is transformed into an informative and coherent summary to generate the final output. Our primary contributions are outlined as follows:",

                "text": "Graph-based Text Summarization Graphs are effective in representing relations and distances between nodes, making them well-suited for modeling text and extracting specific features. Christensen et al. (2013) constructed an approximate discourse graph (ADG) based on discourse relations across sentences. They utilized ADG for selecting summary sentences and achieved more coherent summaries. Subsequent work has expanded upon ADG (Yasunaga et al., 2017; Liu and Lapata, 2019) due to its ability to capture correlation features. Despite the capability of these summarization models to capture graph features, they still require training network layers to bridge the gap between features and outputs. Moreover, a large amount of supervised data is needed to train these parameters. Topic Modelling When identifying semantic clusters, topic models are intuitively suitable. They mine latent topics from document sets to achieve semantic clustering. Classic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) and subsequent neural topic models (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017; Bianchi et al., 2021) require the definition of the number of topics. Despite various metrics available to evaluate the quality of mined topics (Terragni et al., 2021) , determining the optimal number of topics remains challenging. BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022) addresses this by using a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify clusters of varying densities. However, when applied to MDS, its clustering performance is inadequate. This limitation may stem from the fact that while topic models excel at distinguishing texts with different topics, they struggle with semantic clustering where texts share similar topics. In our work, we address this challenge by constructing graphs and leveraging lexical features from raw texts, which proves effective in this scenario.",

While these approaches are valuable, they are limited to compress-ing a single sentence and may fail when dealing with clusters of related sentences. To address this challenge, word graph-based methods offer a potential solution. Nodes and edges are constructed based on specific rules, and constraints are applied to identify the most suitable compression path (Filippova, 2010; Boudin and Morin, 2013; Mehdad et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2018) .

This type of expression can serves as an indicator to connect related sentences. Specifically, we extract verbs from a sentence, 1 filtering out non-notional verbs such as was or had. We then use WordNet to obtain all relevant nominalization forms of verbs. 2 Next, we identify the most similar words for these nouns using word vectors, resulting in a list of nouns to be matched.

This demonstrates that GLIMMER is not only suitable for news articles but can also be applied to other fields such as technical articles. Furthermore, results of GLIMMER surpass non-neural unsupervised approaches and largescale pre-trained models. However, GLIMMER-Eigengap performs poorly on Multi-News, suggesting that this traditional method for determining clustering numbers does not generalize well across different tasks.

Both our TTR-based and distance-based methods show improvements in results. Specifically, TTR-based method performs better than distance-based method.

It's worth as a neural network evaluation framework, UniEval may provide inappropriate scores in some cases. For instance, UniEval struggles to properly evaluate the performance of zero-shot PRIMERA. Although we have confirmed that zero-PRIMERA sometimes generates continuously repeated sentences, UniEval finds it challenging to such instances and may still provide very high fluency and coherence scores, even exceeding manually written reference summaries. Therefore, we omit the results for zero-shot PRIMERA, and we only consider the use of UniEval as a suppleexperiment.",
